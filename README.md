## 📊 Project Goals

- Clean and wrangle sales data
- Visualize trends in chocolate sales by product and country
- Simulate a nonparametric inference (bootstrap) for the median sale amount

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python** (Google Colab)
- **pandas** and **numpy** for data manipulation
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Countries like the UK and Australia had the highest total sales.
- Some chocolate products consistently brought in higher sale amounts.
- The estimated **median sale amount** is around **$5,318**, with a **95% confidence interval** between **$3,969** and **$6,587**.
