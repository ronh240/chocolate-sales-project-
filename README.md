This project explores a dataset of chocolate sales across various countries, products, and sales representatives. The data includes over 1,000 rows and was analyzed using Python in a Jupyter notebook.

---

## Goals of this project 

- Clean and wrangle sales data
- Visualize trends in chocolate sales by product and country
- Simulate a nonparametric inference (bootstrap) for the median sale amount

---

## Tools Used

- **Python** (Google Colab)
- **pandas** and **numpy** for data manipulation
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization

---

##  Key Findings

- Countries like the UK and Australia had the highest total sales.
- Some chocolate products consistently brought in higher sale amounts.
- The estimated **median sale amount** is around **$5,318**, with a **95% confidence interval** between **$3,969** and **$6,587**.

## hat I Learned

This project helped me get more comfortable working with real datasets and applying statistical thinking through bootstrapping. It also gave me practice visualizing trends in a way thatâ€™s easy to explain to others.
